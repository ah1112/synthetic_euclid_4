# Synthetic Euclid 4

This project aims to formalize the first book of Euclid's Elements in Lean 4, based on the framework in [A formal system for Euclidâ€™s elements](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/07CA7E5F8E1C5C2EB632E1005CBE7BEF/S1755020309990098a.pdf/div-class-title-a-formal-system-for-euclid-s-span-class-italic-elements-span-div.pdf). Some of the custom tactics might be of independent interest.

The project can be used either as a standalone or as a package for other projects in Euclidean geometry, such as [Pythagoras4](https://github.com/ianjauslin-rutgers/pythagoras4) (whose README also contains detailed instructions on installing and running Lean 4).
